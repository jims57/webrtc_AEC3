I'd like to implement acoustic echo cancellation(AEC) using WebRTC AEC3, i plan to use cpp or c solution, so that i can write xcframework sdk for ios and aar for android. tell me the best solution, i'd like this AEC3 solution won't feed the sound generated by our api service from the speakers of my ios app or android app back into the microphone in the mobile phone. 

Our ios and android will send text to our custom java api and then the java api will respond pcm streams to our app, so i think we can capture these pcm streams used for tts playback by speakers, and our android app is using API level >=27. in this case, tell me a cross platform solution using cpp with webRTC AEC3 to remove echo of tts

aec quality is important for me, if aec3 is acceptable, i prefer to use WebRTC ace3 for it has better performance in AEC

again, these tts chunks are generated by our tts service, we can get all the pcm chunks in ios and android. we need to play the tts sound by the mobile speaker while the mobile microphone is keeping recording, finally, we need to get echo cancelled streams through aec3, so that we can send the clean streams without echo to our tts service again without dead loop problem.
